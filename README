This site gives a simple web interface to configure the generation of crosstool-ng
(http://ymorin.is-a-geek.org/dokuwiki/projects/crosstool) toolchains and the build
of a minimal linux system using miniroot (http://github.com/tmonjalo/miniroot/tree
/master).
A tiny mysql database must be created in order for the site to be functional. The
mysql code to generate the database is given in DB.sql.
The php scripts work in conjunction with perl scripts that control the flow of the
toolchains' build and the construction of the linux system. These can be found at
http://github.com/hichem/automated_build_system/tree/master.
